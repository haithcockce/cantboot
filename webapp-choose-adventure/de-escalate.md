# Can't-boot First-Responders: De-escalate + capture more data

### Some intial data has been captured so let's try work-arounds

- [Only one kernel was present when last viewing bootloader](de-escalate-rescue.md)

- Multiple kernels were present when last viewing bootloader
  1. Force reset and try each of the older kernels in turn
    - [One of them boots!](congrats.md)
    - [None of them boot!](de-escalate-grubinitrd.md)
