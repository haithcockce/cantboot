<title>Can't-boot First-Responders: De-escalate + capture more data</title>
<xmp theme="united" style="display:none;">

### Some intial data has been captured so let's try work-arounds

- [Only one kernel was present when last viewing bootloader](de-escalate-rescue.html)

- Multiple kernels were present when last viewing bootloader
  1. Force reset and try each of the older kernels in turn
    - [One of them boots!](congrats.html)
    - [None of them boot!](de-escalate-grubinitrd.html)
