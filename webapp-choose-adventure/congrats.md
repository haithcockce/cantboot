# Congrats! It's almost certainly no longer a SEV1!

1. Give yourself a high-five
1. Lower the severity to 2 or 3
1. Have customer capture a sosreport and upload that to case
1. If multiple initrd/initramfs files were involved (i.e., if you chose an older kernel or an alternate initrd/initramfs), have customer upload both initrd/initramfs images to the case
1. Add notes to the case
1. Walk away!
